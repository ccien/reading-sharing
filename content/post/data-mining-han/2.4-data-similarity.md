### 2.4 Measuring Data Similarity and Dissimilarity

Dada similarity is critical for many data mining applications, such as clustering,  outlier analysis, and nearest-neighobr classification.

- A store may want to cluster customers into groups with similar characteristics (e.g. income, area)

#### Proximity meatures for different data types

##### 1. Nominal Attribute

A nominal attribute example: map_color (red, blue, yellow...)
$$
simi(i,j) = \frac{m}{p}
$$
Where $m$ is the number of matches (e.g., the number of attributes for which i and j are in the same state) and $p$ is the total number of attributes

##### 2. Binary Attribute

A binary attribute example: gender (male or female)

**symmetric binary similarity** 
$$
simi(i,j) = \frac{q+t}{q+r+s+t}
$$
**asymmetric binary similarity (Jaccard coefficient)** (for situations where the agreement of a positive match is more significant, e.g. medical examination)
$$
simi(i,j)=\frac{q}{q+r+s}
$$

##### 3. Numeric Attribute

A numeric attribute example: height (1.6m, 1.8m,...)

**Euclidean distance**

**Manhattan (city block ) distance**

**Supremum(Chebyshev) distance**

**Minkowski distance**

Bothe *Euclidean distance* and *Manhattan distance* satisfy **Symmetry**, **Identity of indiscernibles**, **Triangle inequality**, which makes them ***metric***.

##### 4. Ordinal Attribute (attention!!)

The values of an ordinal attribute have a meanful ranking, but the *magnitude between successive values is unknown.* For example, size attribute (small, medium, large)

*first*, mapping ordinal attribute to numeric attribute:
$$
z_{if} = \frac{r_{if}-1}{M_f-1}
$$
Where $f$ is an ordinal attribute, $M_f$ is the maximum ranking value, $r_{if}$ is the ranking values of object $i$.
