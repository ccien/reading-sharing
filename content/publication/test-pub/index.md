abstract = "In order to effectively infer correct labels from noisy crowdsourced annotations, learning-from-crowds models have introduced expert validation. However, little research has been done on facilitating the validation procedure. In this paper, we propose an interactive method to assist experts in verifying uncertain instance labels and unreliable workers. Given the instance labels and worker reliability inferred from a learning-from-crowds model, candidate instances and workers are selected for expert validation. The influence of verified results is propagated to relevant instances and workers through the learning-from-crowds model. To facilitate the validation of annotations, we have developed a confusion visualization to indicate the confusing classes for further exploration, a constrained projection method to show the uncertain labels in context, and a scatter-plot-based visualization to illustrate worker reliability. The three visualizations are tightly integrated with the learning-from-crowds model to provide an iterative and progressive environment for data validation. Two case studies were conducted that demonstrate our approach offers an efficient method for validating and improving crowdsourced annotations."
